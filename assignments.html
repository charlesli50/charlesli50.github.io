            I aleady had a resume website from many years ago. I simply found
            the files on my computer, imported it into github, and
            updated/rewrote everything to the standard of the class.

            A lot of the trouble I had was of remembering python syntax.
            However, it was also rather difficult to understand if what I was
            doing was correct, given the very tight margins that the data
            beheld. I believe my answer is still correct, but I wouldn't doubt
            if it was simply a result of fudged data. I still had fun doing this
            assignment though.
